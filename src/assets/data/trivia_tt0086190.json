        "According to Ian McDiarmid, George Lucas originally cast him simply as the physical performance of the Emperor (similar to David Prowse as Darth Vader). This became evident to him when a producer told him that if he was able to get his voice close enough to Clive Revill's (who portrayed the Emperor's voice in O Império Contra-Ataca (1980)) Lucas would let him use his on-camera vocals in the final cut of the film. However, McDiarmid felt he could conduct a stronger, more wicked and demonic voice for the Emperor as opposed to Revill's more aristocratic Emperor. Lucas, and even Steven Spielberg, were so impressed with his take that it ended up becoming a signature trait of the character.  ",
        "Carrie Fisher complained about her costumes in the previous two movies. She said they were so long, you could not tell \"she was a woman\". Those complaints led to the skimpy outfit she wore as Jabba's slave. The costume became something of a running joke among the crew, because the metal framework that held the top together meant that the costume didn't move well with her. Since Fisher didn't like the industry standard solution of using double-sided tape, it became necessary before each take to have a wardrobe person check to ensure that her breasts were still snug inside the costume top (and several scenes had to be re-shot when \"wardrobe malfunctions\" occurred).

As a result, Lucas hired the relatively unknown (and at the time non-union) Welsh director Richard Marquand.

However, when a scene of Luke assembling and activating his new saber, (still blue), was cut, George Lucas thought the audience might not understand that Luke's ROTJ lightsaber was not the exact same one he lost on Cloud City. To avoid confusion, Lucas decided to change the color from blue to green, making it clear that Luke was using a new saber. (As part of the Expanded Universe -Legends-, Luke's original lightsaber, used by his father and given to him by Obi-Wan, was recovered (along with his severed hand) from Cloud City and was later wielded by a Luke clone.

One of these actresses did survive into the final cut film: one of the A-Wing pilots is actually a woman redubbed by a male actor. The most significant cut was French model and actress Vivienne Chandler, who played an unnamed female X-wing pilot (later named Dorovio Bold). What made her cut surprising was that it appeared she would have played a significant role in the battle, as she recorded over a full page of dialogue. Footage of her in the cockpit of her X-wing recently resurfaced, indicating she was among the pilots to assault the Death Star itself, and her dialogue (in which she makes a distress call about a fatally-damaged stabilizer) suggests she would have been killed after crashing much like Red Leader had in the original film. It's unclear exactly why the women were cut, but it's been speculated there were concerns that audiences would be made uncomfortable by the thought of women being killed during a battle sequence.  ",

Instead, as soon as production began, the entire company found it necessary to remain running 20 hours a day on six-day weeks in order to meet their goals by April 1, 1983.

The first line in this film is one of Vader's henchmen in his shuttle asking to board the Death Star. The first lines in Episode I are of Qui-Gon and his pilot asking to be let aboard the Trade Federation Control Ship. Vader's last scenes involve him throwing the Emperor down a chasm to his death, and being mortally wounded in the process.

        "Mark Hamill has said he took great issue with the revelation that Luke and Leia are brother and sister, going so far as to accuse George Lucas of making the idea up on the plane ride to set! Lucas, however, wanted to end the Star Wars saga to spend more time with his family. Lucas therefore opted to combine the character of Luke's unseen sister with Leia, thus resolving the Skywalker family story line and the Han-Leia-Luke love triangle in this film, thereby making it the definitive end to the Star Wars saga. That would change years later with the sale of LucasFilm to Disney and production on Star Wars: O Despertar da Força (2015), which would continue the story of the Skywalker family. The Disney-produced sequel trilogy, however, does not integrate any of Lucas' original ideas for post-O Retorno de Jedi (1983) sequels.  ",

They haven't told me anything about it except that it has something to do with science fiction.\"  ",

        "In the most recent special edition, the force-ghost of Anakin Skywalker portrayed by Sebastian Shaw is replaced with one by Hayden Christensen from Star Wars: Episódio III - A Vingança dos Sith (2005). George Lucas felt the force-ghost should represent Anakin as he was before he succumbed to the Dark Side. Also, in \"Sith\", Anakin was horribly burned and lost both legs and his left hand, an aspect added after the original trilogy. Despite the explanation by Lucas, or perhaps because of it, many fans were outraged over the change and wrote angry letters to Lucas.  ",
        "When George Lucas originally mapped out the plot of the entire \"Star Wars\" series, he refined the backstory he'd used writing the original film, and concocted further stories for sequels. Initially thinking the series would run two trilogies, he eventually settled on three. The original trilogy would follow Luke Skywalker as he became a Jedi and fought Darth Vader. The second \"prequel\" trilogy would follow young Obi-Wan Kenobi and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. The third, a sequel trilogy, would follow Luke twin sister, Nelleth Skywalker. Originally, this film would have ended with Luke defeating Vader and embarking on the search for Nelleth. However, with production of O Império Contra-Ataca (1980) and this film taking an enormous toll on Lucas' health and personal life (he and wife Marcia Lucas divorced shortly after the release of this film), he opted to end the series here by making Leia into Luke's sister.
